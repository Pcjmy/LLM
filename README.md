### 01 Build Your Own Small Language Model

In this Google DeepMind course, you will learn the fundamentals of language models and gain a high-level understanding of the machine learning development pipeline. You will consider the strengths and limitations of traditional n-gram models and advanced transformer models. Practical coding labs will enable you to develop insights into how machine learning models work and how they can be used to generate text and identify patterns in language. Through real-world case studies, you will build an understanding around how research engineers operate. Drawing on these insights you will identify problems that you wish to tackle in your own community and consider how to leverage the power of machine learning responsibly to address these problems within a global and local context.
